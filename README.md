# CS-221: Data Structures Class Work

This repository contains my class work and assignments for the CS-221: Data Structures course. Here, you can find the implementation of various data structures and algorithms covered during the semester.

## Description

In this course, we explore fundamental data structures and algorithms essential for efficient problem-solving in computer science. The primary focus includes but is not limited to:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or assignment covered in the CS-221 course.

## Directory Structure

- **[Project1](Project1):** A program that would perform image utilities (Rotating, Transposing, etc) given a 2D Matrix. Tested using a program driver.

- **[Project2](Project2):** An inheritance project involving on setting up classes corresponding to a 52-Card Deck from a given UML Diagram (Card-Color-Suit). Tested using a program driver.

- **[Project3](Project3):** A linked list assignment, designed to hold different characters and their attributes for a "Dungeons and Dragons" like game. Tested using a program driver.

- **[Project4](Project4):** An extension of Project 3, where a Binary Search Tree was implemented to store relevant items for each character. Tested using a program driver.

- **[Project5](Project5):** An extension of Projects 3 and 4, where a 'dungeon' was implemented as an adjacency matrix graph. Commands were read in through the console or via an input file (cmd.txt)

- **[Project6](Project6):** A program that performed a number of hash functions given a text file that contained data and a key. Analysis of these hashing functions are given at the end of the program via report, this includes a collision counter.

Feel free to explore each directory to find the relevant code for different assignments.
